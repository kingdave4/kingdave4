## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m David â€“ Cloud & DevOps Engineer

Iâ€™m a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with a passion for building automated, resilient infrastructure and end-to-end data solutions in both Azure and AWS. I hold the Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104) certification and leverage tools like Terraform, Bicep, Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, and Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions to deliver scalable, secure, and maintainable environments.

**Recent projects include:**

* **Hugo Portfolio & Blog**: Deployed my personal site using Hugo, GitHub, and Terraform on Azure. Tech Stack: Hugo, Terraform, Azure, GitHub Actions
* **Azure NBA Data Lake**: Provisioning a complete Azure Data Lake and automating NBA data ingestion with Azure Functions. Tech Stack: Azure, Terraform, Azure Function App, Python, Key Vault, Synapse, Application Insights
* **Foci-Solutions Todo App**: Collaborated on a Vue/Vite frontend and Node/Express backend; containerized and deployed with Kubernetes and Azure Static Web Apps (frontend) + Azure Container Instances (backend) via Terraform and Azure DevOps.

I love tackling cloud challenges, whether itâ€™s spinning up a data lake, crafting CI/CD pipelines, or enabling real-time observability and Iâ€™m always excited to explore new tools and architectures to optimize performance, security, and reliability.
